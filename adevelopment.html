    <h1> What did I achieve Academically?</h1>
    <p>
        This semester, was very different academically. Have school online is <br>
        a whole new experience. It is no where near the same as having a class in <br>
        person because it is just so much easier to get distracted at home, and <br>
        the information we get usually just goes in one ear, and out the other. <br>
        Though this semester, I feel like I was able to academically hold myself accountable. <br>
        Without having a teacher there to make sure that I was paying attention, <br>
        I would be hard on myself about doing things I enjoyed. I would make sure all <br>
        my work is done, then I would do whatever I want. I also made sure that I <br>
        paid attention during the lectures and that I went back and studied on my own <br>
        because that is probably the most important thing to do with this online schooling <br>
        system. I was able to procrastinate much less this year, and I was about to prove to myself <br>
        how capable I am of doing things without as much help as I had access to before.
