    <h1> What did I achieve personally?</h1>
    <p>
        This semester, I feel like I approved a lot about myself. Things were very different this year, <br>
        as COVID played a huge factor in many things. Not only that, but I started off working 3 jobs <br>
        and now I at two. Working two jobs and having more responsibilities this semester allowed me to get a feel <br>
        for the future. I was very dependent on myself, and I had to learn how to manage my time correctly <br>
        that way I had enough time for myself, work, and my school work. Although COVID did affect many peoples lives negatively, <br>
        I think it pushed people to working harder then ever before, and it was a reminder to many that not everything <br>
        stays perfect. Something big that I was also able to accomplish was getting my first car. <br>
        I used to always talk about wanting to turn 18 so I can get my own car, and I <br>
        was finally able to do it.
